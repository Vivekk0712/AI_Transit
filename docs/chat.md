I have addressed the issues you pointed out. Here are the changes I've made:

1.  **Cost and Time:** The cost is now in rupees, and the time is formatted in a more readable way (e.g., "1 hr 50 min").
2.  **Train Option:** The "Train" option will now appear for long-distance travel.
3.  **AI Descriptions:** I have provided more context to the OpenAI API to generate more relevant and creative descriptions for each travel option.

Please try making a travel query again. You should see the updated results.
