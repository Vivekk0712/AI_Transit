I have updated the backend to provide a more realistic experience. Here's what I've changed:

- The `recommend` function now uses the Nominatim API to get the coordinates of the source and destination.
- It then calculates the distance between the two points.
- Based on the distance, it estimates the cost and time for different modes of transport (Bus, Auto, Cab).
- Finally, it uses the OpenAI API to generate a friendly AI description for each travel option.

This removes the hardcoded mock data and provides a more dynamic and realistic implementation based on the stories in `stories.md`.

Please try making a travel query again. You should now get back a list of travel options with AI-generated descriptions.
